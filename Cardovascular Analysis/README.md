            Cardiovascular Diseases Analysis and Prediction



Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of mortality worldwide, highlighting the critical need for advancements in early detection and prevention strategies. This project centres around the analysis and prediction of heart disease using the Heart Attack Dataset, which comprises a comprehensive collection of health attributes from over 900 patients. The goal is to explore and analyze these data points to uncover patterns that can predict cardiovascular risks and assist in making informed medical decisions.

Objectives:
This project aims to address several key research questions:

Chest Pain and Heart Disease: How does the type of chest pain relate to the incidence of heart disease within the dataset?
Gender, Age, and Risk Correlation: What are the correlations between gender, age, and the likelihood of a heart attack?
Impact of Clinical Factors: To what extent do factors such as exercise-induced angina, high cholesterol levels, and abnormal fasting blood sugar levels elevate heart attack risk?
Cholesterol and Age Relationship: How do cholesterol levels vary with age, and what is their potential impact on heart disease?
In addition to answering these questions, the project also aims to develop a predictive model to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing cardiovascular diseases more accurately and efficiently than traditional manual methods.

Key Components:
Data Wrangling:

The project begins with data wrangling steps, including loading the dataset and performing initial data exploration. This stage is crucial for understanding the structure of the data and preparing it for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Detailed exploratory data analysis is conducted to identify patterns, correlations, and trends within the dataset. Visualization techniques are likely used to illustrate the relationships between different variables, such as age, cholesterol levels, chest pain type, and their association with heart disease.
Feature Engineering:

The project may involve transforming raw data into meaningful features that can be used in predictive modeling. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical data.
Predictive Modeling:

Using machine learning techniques, the project builds a predictive model to classify patients based on their risk of heart disease. Various algorithms may be tested and evaluated to determine the most effective model for this task.
Model Evaluation:

The modelâ€™s performance is assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the ROC curve. This step ensures that the predictive tool is reliable and can be used confidently in clinical settings.
Insights and Recommendations:

The results from the analysis and model predictions are interpreted to provide actionable insights. The project may offer recommendations for healthcare providers on which factors to monitor closely for early detection of heart disease.
